# Casino Offer Prioritization System

## Overview

This intelligent research tool helps identify gaps in casino offer coverage and prioritizes promotional offers using a smart scoring algorithm.

## Features

### 1. **Smart Prioritization Algorithm**

The system scores each offer based on four weighted factors:

- **Value Ratio (40%)**: Bonus-to-deposit ratio (higher is better)
- **Absolute Bonus Amount (30%)**: Total bonus value (normalized using logarithmic scale)
- **Offer Type (20%)**: Weighted preference (Lossback > Deposit > Others)
- **Accessibility (10%)**: Lower deposit requirements score higher

#### Priority Tiers
- **High Priority (75-100)**: üî• Exceptional offers worth pursuing
- **Medium Priority (50-74)**: ‚≠ê Good offers worth considering
- **Low Priority (0-49)**: üìã Standard offers

### 2. **Coverage Gap Analysis**

The system automatically identifies:

#### State Gaps
- States with below-average offer counts
- Percentage comparison to average coverage

#### Casino Expansion Opportunities
- Casinos operating in only one state
- Potential multi-state expansion targets

#### Offer Type Imbalance
- Underrepresented offer types (especially valuable Lossback offers)
- Distribution percentages

#### Value Gaps
- States with below-average bonus values
- Comparison to overall average

#### Missing Major Operators
- Identifies if major casinos (BetMGM, DraftKings, FanDuel, etc.) are missing

### 3. **Sorting Options**

- **Priority Score**: AI-calculated priority (default)
- **Highest Bonus**: Sort by absolute bonus amount
- **Best Value**: Sort by value ratio (bonus/deposit)
- **State**: Alphabetical by state

### 4. **Detailed Insights**

Click any row to expand and see:

- **Full offer description**

## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. Click "Run Search" on the home page
2. Use the sort controls to view offers by different criteria
3. Click "Show Insights" to see coverage gaps and recommendations
4. Click any offer row to see detailed scoring breakdown

### Research Workflow

1. **Start with Priority Sort**: See the most valuable offers first
2. **Review High Priority Offers** (score ‚â• 75): These are exceptional opportunities
3. **Check Insights Dashboard**: Identify coverage gaps

### Understanding Value Indicators

- **Blue badges (‚â•100% value)**: Standard match offers
- **Gray badges (<100% value)**: Below-average value ratio

## Scoring Examples

### Example 1: High Priority Offer
```
Casino: Four Winds
Offer: 200% Deposit Bonus, max $200
Deposit: $100
Bonus: $200
Priority Score: 85.4

Breakdown:
- Value Ratio: 96 (200% return)
- Bonus Amount: 67
- Offer Type: 85 (Deposit Cashable)
- Accessibility: 96 (Low $100 deposit)

Insights:
- üéØ Exceptional value: 200% return on deposit
- üíµ Low entry: Only $100 deposit
```

### Example 2: Medium Priority Offer
```
Casino: Caesars Palace
Offer: 100% Deposit Match Up To $1,000
Deposit: $1,000
Bonus: $1,010
Priority Score: 64.8

Breakdown:
- Value Ratio: 50 (100% return)
- Bonus Amount: 89 (High bonus)
- Offer Type: 85 (Deposit Cashable)
- Accessibility: 40 (Higher $1,000 deposit)

Insights:
- ‚úÖ Good value: 100% match
- üí∞ High bonus amount: $1,010
```

## Gap Analysis Examples

### State Coverage Gap
```
Type: State
Severity: High
Description: West Virginia has only 8 offers (40% of average)
Recommendation: Research more casinos operating in West Virginia 
or check for missing promotions from existing casinos.
```

### Casino Expansion Opportunity
```
Type: Casino
Severity: Medium
Description: Jackpocket only operates in New Jersey but has 1 offers there
Recommendation: Check if Jackpocket operates in Pennsylvania, Michigan, 
West Virginia. Multi-state casinos often have similar offers.
```

### Offer Type Imbalance
```
Type: Offer Type
Severity: Medium
Description: Only 15 Lossback offers (27.3% of total)
Recommendation: Lossback offers are valuable risk-free options. 
Search for casinos offering 'money back', 'insurance', or 'risk-free' promotions.
```

## Future Enhancements

### When AI Integration is Added

The current smart function can be enhanced with:

1. **Natural Language Queries**: "Find best offers in Pennsylvania with low deposit"
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare offers across states automatically
3. **Trend Detection**: Identify seasonal patterns and emerging offers
4. **Personalized Recommendations**: Based on user preferences and history
5. **Automated Research**: AI scraping to find new offers based on gap recommendations

### Extending the Algorithm

To customize the scoring algorithm, edit `lib/utils/offer-prioritization.ts`:

```typescript
const WEIGHTS = {
  valueRatio: 0.4,      // Adjust weight for value ratio
  bonusAmount: 0.3,     // Adjust weight for bonus amount
  offerType: 0.2,       // Adjust weight for offer type
  accessibility: 0.1,   // Adjust weight for accessibility
};
```
