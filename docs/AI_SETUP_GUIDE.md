## How to Use AI Features

### Using AI Offer Discovery

1. Click "Run Search" on the home page
2. Click "Show Insights" button
3. You'll see an "AI-Powered Research Tools" section
4. Select a state (e.g., "Pennsylvania")
5. Click "Research [State] Offers"
6. Wait 3-5 seconds for AI to research and return results
7. Review discovered offers with confidence ratings

**What it does:**
- Searches for casino promotions in that state
- Focuses on missing casinos from your database
- Returns offers with deposit/bonus amounts
- Provides source information and notes

### Using AI Offer Analysis

1. Click any offer row in the table to expand it
2. Scroll down to the "AI Deep Analysis" section (purple gradient)
3. Click "Analyze Quality"
4. Wait 2-3 seconds for analysis
5. Review:
   - Overall quality score
   - Actual value estimate
   - Hidden restrictions
   - Warnings
   - Positive aspects

**What it does:**
- Analyzes offer for hidden terms
- Estimates wagering requirements
- Identifies time restrictions
- Provides honest assessment of value

### Using AI Strategic Recommendations

1. Make sure you have coverage gaps identified
2. In the Insights Dashboard, scroll to "AI Strategy Recommendations"
3. Click "Generate Strategy"
4. Wait 3-5 seconds
5. Review prioritized action items with effort estimates

**What it does:**
- Analyzes all identified gaps
- Creates prioritized research plan
- Suggests which gaps to tackle first
- Estimates effort required

## Troubleshooting

### "AI Features Not Configured" Warning

**Problem**: API key not detected

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure `.env.local` exists in project root
2. Check the filename is exactly `.env.local` (not `.env` or `.env.local.txt`)
3. Verify the variable name is `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY`
4. Make sure you restarted the dev server after adding the file
5. Check for typos in your API key

### "Failed to discover offers" Error

**Possible causes**:
1. Invalid API key
2. Rate limit exceeded (15 requests/minute)
3. Network connection issue
4. API service temporarily down

**Solutions**:
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Wait 1 minute and try again
3. Check your internet connection
4. Try again in a few minutes

### AI Responses Are Slow

**This is normal!** AI analysis takes 2-5 seconds because:
- The model needs to process your request
- It's generating intelligent, context-aware responses
- It's searching and analyzing data

**Tips**:
- Only use AI features when you need them
- Don't spam the buttons (respect rate limits)
- The algorithm-based scoring is instant - use that for quick results

## Best Practices

### When to Use AI

‚úÖ **Use AI for:**
- Discovering new offers you don't have
- Analyzing complex offer terms
- Planning research strategy
- Understanding hidden restrictions

‚ùå **Don't use AI for:**
- Scoring existing offers (algorithm does this instantly)
- Basic filtering/sorting (UI controls handle this)
- Repeated analysis of same offer (save the first result)

### Cost Management

**Free Tier Limits:**
- 15 requests per minute
- 1,500 requests per day

**Tips to stay within limits:**
- Don't click AI buttons repeatedly
- Save AI analysis results when you find them useful
- Use algorithmic features first, AI features second
- One AI research per state per day is usually enough

### Data Quality

**Confidence Ratings:**
- **High**: AI found clear, recent information
- **Medium**: Information is available but may need verification
- **Low**: AI is making educated guesses - verify manually

**Always verify:**
- Visit casino websites to confirm offers
- Check terms and conditions
- Verify bonus amounts and deposit requirements
- AI provides leads, you confirm accuracy

## Privacy & Security

**Your API Key:**
- Keep it private (never commit `.env.local` to git)
- Don't share it publicly
- Regenerate it if accidentally exposed

**Data Sent to AI:**
- Only offer names, amounts, and casino names
- No personal information
- No sensitive data
- All prompts are in this file: `lib/ai/gemini-service.ts`

## Advanced: Customizing AI Prompts

Want to adjust how AI responds? Edit `lib/ai/gemini-service.ts`:

```typescript
// Example: Make AI more conservative in estimates
const prompt = `You are a conservative casino promotions analyst...
Be realistic and conservative in your analysis...`;
```

All prompts are clearly documented in the service file.

A: If you deploy, API key is embedded. Set usage limits in Google Console.

**Q: What if I hit rate limits?**
A: Free tier: 15 req/min, 1,500/day. Wait a minute or upgrade (rarely needed).
