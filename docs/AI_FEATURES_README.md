# AI-Powered Casino Promotions Research Tool

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **hybrid intelligent research tool** that combines algorithmic scoring with AI-powered discovery and analysis for casino promotional offers.

## 🏗️ Architecture: Hybrid Approach

### Why Hybrid?

This project uses **the best tool for each job**:

| Task | Tool | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Scoring offers | **Algorithm** | Instant, free, deterministic, explainable |
| Discovering new offers | **AI (Gemini)** | Can search web, understand context |
| Analyzing offer quality | **AI (Gemini)** | Can read terms, identify hidden restrictions |
| Strategic planning | **AI (Gemini)** | Can reason about priorities |
| Sorting/filtering | **Algorithm** | Instant, precise |

**Result**: Fast, cost-effective, and intelligent! ⚡💰🧠

## 🤖 AI Features

### 1. AI Offer Discovery 🔍

**Location**: Insights Dashboard → Select State → "Research [State] Offers"

**What it does:**
- Searches for current casino promotions in selected state
- Focuses on missing casinos from your database
- Finds new offers you don't have
- Returns structured data with confidence ratings

**Example Output:**
```
Casino: DraftKings
Offer: "100% Deposit Match up to $2,000"
Deposit: $2,000
Bonus: $2,000
Confidence: High
Notes: "First deposit only, 1x playthrough requirement"
```

**Cost**: ~$0.01 per search
**Time**: 3-5 seconds

### 2. AI Offer Quality Analysis 🧠

**Location**: Click any offer row → Expand → "Analyze Quality"

**What it does:**
- Deep analysis of offer terms
- Identifies wagering requirements
- Spots time restrictions
- Finds game limitations
- Calculates actual expected value
- Provides honest quality score (0-100)

**Example Output:**
```
Overall Score: 72/100
Actual Value: "Good offer with standard 10x wagering"
Warnings:
- Likely 10-15x rollover requirement
- Usually 30-day expiration
- May be slots-only
Positives:
- Competitive bonus amount
- Reputable casino
- Cashable bonus
```

**Cost**: ~$0.005 per analysis
**Time**: 2-3 seconds

### 3. AI Strategic Recommendations 🎯

**Location**: Insights Dashboard → "Generate Strategy"

**What it does:**
- Analyzes all coverage gaps
- Creates prioritized action plan
- Estimates effort required
- Provides reasoning for each recommendation

**Example Output:**
```
Priority: HIGH | Effort: Medium
Action: "Research BetMGM offers in Pennsylvania"
Reasoning: "BetMGM is present in 3 other states with similar offers. 
High likelihood of finding comparable PA offers."
```

**Cost**: ~$0.01 per generation
**Time**: 3-5 seconds

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### API Key Security

**What we do:**
- ✅ Store API key in `.env.local` (never committed to git)
- ✅ Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side access
- ✅ No server-side proxy needed (simpler architecture)

**What you should do:**
- ✅ Never commit `.env.local` to git
- ✅ Never share your API key publicly
- ✅ Regenerate key if accidentally exposed
- ✅ Set usage quotas in Google Console if deploying publicly

### Data Privacy

**What's sent to AI:**
- Offer names and descriptions
- Casino names
- Deposit and bonus amounts
- State names

**What's NOT sent:**
- User information
- Personal data
- Sensitive business logic
- API credentials

**All AI prompts are open and reviewable** in `lib/ai/gemini-service.ts`

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Design Philosophy

**Progressive Enhancement:**
1. Core features work without AI (algorithmic scoring)
2. AI features enhance the experience
3. Clear visual indicators for AI status
4. Graceful degradation if API fails

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- **Blue** = AI discovery/research
- **Purple** = AI analysis/deep insights
- **Yellow** = Warnings/setup needed
- **Green** = Success/positive results

### User Feedback

**Loading States:**
- Spinner animations during AI requests
- "Analyzing..." text to set expectations
- Disabled buttons to prevent double-clicks

**Error Handling:**
- Clear error messages
- Suggestions for resolution
- Non-blocking (other features still work)

**Success States:**
- Animated entry of results
- Color-coded confidence indicators
- Expandable details

### Key Design Decisions

**1. Client-Side AI Calls**
- Pro: Simpler architecture, no backend needed
- Pro: Lower latency (direct to Google)
- Con: API key visible in client (acceptable for demo)
- **Decision**: Perfect for demo/prototype stage

**2. JSON Response Format**
- Forces AI to return structured data
- Easy to parse and display
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Handles parsing errors gracefully

**3. Confidence Ratings**
- AI provides self-assessment of certainty
- Helps users know what to verify
- Encourages good research practices

**4. Hybrid Approach**
- Algorithm handles what it's good at (math, sorting)
- AI handles what it's good at (research, reasoning)
- Best of both worlds

## 🧪 Testing AI Features

### Without API Key (Demo Mode)

The app shows:
- ⚠️ Yellow setup banner with instructions
- Algorithm-based features still work perfectly
- No AI panels visible (clean UX)

### With API Key (Full Features)

Test each feature:

**Test 1: Offer Discovery**
1. Go to Insights → Select "Pennsylvania"
2. Click "Research Pennsylvania Offers"
3. Should return 5-10 offers in 3-5 seconds
4. Verify confidence ratings appear

**Test 2: Quality Analysis**
1. Click any offer to expand
2. Click "Analyze Quality" in purple section
3. Should return analysis in 2-3 seconds
4. Verify score, warnings, and positives appear

**Test 3: Strategy Recommendations**
1. In Insights Dashboard
2. Click "Generate Strategy"
3. Should return 5-7 recommendations
4. Verify priority levels and effort estimates

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "AI Features Not Configured"

**Cause**: No API key detected

**Fix**:
1. Create `.env.local` in project root
2. Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key`
3. Restart dev server
4. Refresh browser

### "Failed to discover offers"

**Possible causes**:
- Invalid API key → Check for typos
- Rate limit → Wait 60 seconds
- Network issue → Check internet
- Service issue → Try again later

### AI Responses Seem Wrong

**Remember**:
- AI makes educated guesses based on patterns
- Always verify offers on official casino websites
- Confidence ratings indicate certainty level
- Low confidence = definitely verify manually
